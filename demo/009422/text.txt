Right lobe of liver shows an infiltrating retractile mass lesion with heterogeneous enhancement. The lateral, superior and inferior margins of the lesion show enhancement in delayed phase whereas the medial aspect of the lesion close to the left lobe shows arterial phase enhancement with washout in subsequent phases.Lesion measures approximately 10 x 6 cm and is seen to infiltrate and obliterate the right hepatic duct and extend into the porta hepatis where it infiltrates the proximal common bile duct with resultant IHBR dilatation in the left lobe of the liver. CBD stent seen in situ.Right portal vein, right hepatic artery are seen passing through the tumour without significant luminal narrowing. Right and middle hepatic veins are infiltrated and obliterated by the tumour. Main portal vein, common hepatic artery and their branches supplying the left lobe are free of tumour.Multiple other ring enhancing lesion are scattered in both lobes of liver suggestive of metastasis
