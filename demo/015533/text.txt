Non-contrast CT Brain shows a well-defined and lobulated cystic lesion within the medial aspect of the right middle cranial fossa, apparently arising from the right cavernous sinus and showing long-standing features as bone remodeling (best spotted at the petrous apex). Its low attenuation component measures approximately 0 HU. The features can be related to a arachnoid cyst, further evaluation with MRI is advised.
